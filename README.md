# -Hello-world
I don't know what I am doing but it is interesting.
i think ill keep on going with this as it seems even more interesting than i thought.
i am enjoying it but still dont know where github is going to lead me too.
i thought its only a platform where people talk about code stuff but its seems like more off a coding group study.
i may be wrong.
